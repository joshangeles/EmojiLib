# Emoji-Lib

## About
A web application for Discord users who want to use new emojis in their servers.

EmojiLib is an application that I built to import multiple emojis into Discord servers. Through using Discord I had noticed that adding multiple emojis into a server at once was tedious, and by utilizing a bot that already had access to the emojis that I would like, it would make the process much easier.
